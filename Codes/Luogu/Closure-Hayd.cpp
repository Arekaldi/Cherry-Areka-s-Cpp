Talor 也唱过？
Did we both fall in love

Before we were ready?

Or did we both give up

Before we were steady?

I don't know, I don't know, all I know

Is that now I'm alone

Were we both too scared?

Or were we well-prepared?

For the future and all

The mistakes that it bears

I don't know, I don't know, all I know

Is that now I'm alone

Yeah, these are questions in my head

Answers I won't get

Thoughts I never said

That I kinda wish I did

I guess sometimes you find the one

But the timing's off

The place is wrong

Maybe we would be closer

If we were a couple years older

I guess sometimes you fall in love

Then one day feels like you wake up

And everything's over

Without any closure

Did we both think that this

Was the best that we found?

Or were we too afraid

To have no one around?

I don't know, I don't know, all I know

Is that now I'm alone

Did we hope on a star

A bit too far?

Was the distance between

Too great for our hearts?

I don't know, I don't know, all I know

Is that now I'm alone

Yeah, these are questions in my head

Answers I won't get

Thoughts I never said

That I kinda wish I did

I guess sometimes you find the one

But the timing's off

The place is wrong

Maybe we would be closer

If we were a couple years older

I guess sometimes you fall in love

Then one day feels like you wake up

And everything's over

Without any closure
