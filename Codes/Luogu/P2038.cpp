/*
We were both young when I first saw you

I closed my eyes and the flashback starts

I'm standing there

On a balcony in summer air

See the lights see the party the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd

And say hello

Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

And I was crying on the staircase

Begging you please don't go

And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story

Baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you

We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes

Escape this town for a little while

Oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was the scarlet letter

And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

But you were everything to me

I was begging you please don't go

And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story

Baby just say yes

Romeo save me

Theyâ€™re trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult but it's real

Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess

It's a love story

Baby just say yes

Oh oh

I got tired of waiting

Wondering if you were ever coming around

My faith in you was fading

When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said

Romeo save me

I've been feeling so alone

I keep waiting for you but you never come

Is this in my head

I don't know what to think

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

And said

Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone

I love you and that's all I really know

I talked to your dad

Go pick out a white dress

It's a love story

Baby just say yes

Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
